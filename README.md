## CP-NET: Hemi-NET Clinical Database Release

# Cerebral Palsy Neuroscience Discovery Network (CP-NET)

# Overview

This controlled data release focuses on CP-NET's initial Clinical Database which solely focused on children and youth, aged 2-18, with a confirmed diagnosis of hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP). The Hemi-NET Clinical Database has data on 320 children and youth from across Ontario. The released data is organized around the following platforms: (1) Clinical Risk Factor Platform: clinically relevant neonatal and obstetric risk factors from obstetrical and neonatal health charts, (2) Genomics Platform: saliva samples acquired from the index child and both biological parent(s), (3) Neuroimaging Platform: standardized coding of clinically acquired neuroimaging, (4) Neurodevelopmental Platform: standardized assessments of gross motor, fine motor, language, cognitive, behavioural function, and self-reported quality of life.

# Data organization

Data is organized into packages by Imaging Scan Type, Genomic Data Type, and Clinical Data Collection Domain.
